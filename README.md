# Java desktop calculator

---

## Description

This project is a simple desktop calculator with basic functions such as 4 arithmetic operations, number sign switch,
clear button, and it is working with float point numbers. Project written in Java and it uses [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) framework to work with user
interface.

I wrote this project because I was interested in JavaFX framework and because ~~every developer should write his own calculator~~ 
I want to know, how is it writing desktop application with user interface.
